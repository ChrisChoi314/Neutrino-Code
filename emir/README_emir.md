# Emir

This directory has all my work with the paper "Gravitational wave signal from massive gravity" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5975.pdf by A. Emir Gumrukcuoglu, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Chunshan Lin, Shinji Mukohyama, and Norihiro Tanahashi

All of the files (besides emir_func.py, *_copy.py files, *test.py, *_try.py), have a folder with the attachment "_figs" at the end of the name of the python file associated with them. These are the folders that contain the figures generated from the associated python file. 

# Files and what they do
- emir.py was my first look at the paper and has a lot of attempts at recreating the figures in the paper. Nothing is really well documented in that file so you can safely ignore my incoherent code in that file.
- emir_P.py includes my efforts to replicate the power spectrums shown in the paper, so this includes Fig. 4, 5, and 6 from the main paper. These correspond to the plots emir/emir_P_figs/fig2.pdf, emir/emir_P_figs/fig3.pdf, and emir/emir_P_figs/fig5.pdf respectively. The file emir/emir_P_figs/fig10.pdf has some other masses plus the senstivity curve for the 15 year NANOGrav dataset.
