# Neutrino-Code
This is code I write for my research with Dr. Kahniashvili regarding the effect free streaming neutrinos in the early universe radiation-dominated era have on the gravitational waves generated from the QCD Electroweak era.

Also includes the research done on massive gravity, if gravitons were actually massive and not massless, and its affects on the power spectrum and whether it would be observable at a certain range of frequencies.
